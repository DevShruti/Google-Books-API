# Google-Books-API
#### A creative project to use Google Books API
##### Project inspiration from [Zentech](https://youtu.be/bsZKDIaij-A) and [Karen Henwood](https://codepen.io/karenhenwood/pen/ybQYxO)
###### I have spent past few months learning on #Scrimba and I wanted to introduce everyone to Scrimba. I am making a Google Books API project and thought of making scrims with each step. Here is my first #scrim. You can view it, even edit it and fork and do your own thing with it, all without being logged in to #Scrimba. I hope you will spend few minutes of your day to see this fantastic technology and listen to my very bad explanation of starting the project.
